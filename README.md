# BookBridge
A campus focused book exchange platform with in-app chat.

## Targetted Audience
- Students looking for affordable books for their classes or personal reading.
- Students who want to lend out their books or make quick cash by selling them within the university.

## Problem
- College textbooks are expensive, and most students only need them for a semester or two.
- Buying and selling old books is unorganized and unreliable, and most platforms donâ€™t cater specifically to students within a single university.

## Solution and Features
- A platform designed for university campuses where students can list or search for books.
- Filtering options by major, course name, or course code.
- In-app messaging to contact the book owner directly, with more reliability due to the closed, campus-specific community.
