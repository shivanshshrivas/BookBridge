## Harry the Borrower

Harry is a college student on a scholarship. He doesn't come from a wealthy background, but he's full of curiosity and ambition. He's passionate about Electrical Engineering and always carries a screwdriver is his bag in case he finds something interesting to open up and learn from. 

Every semester, Harry struggles to afford the textbooks required for his courses. He usually borrows from his seniors, but the process is unreliable and stressful. One day, his friend Larry tells him about a new website for campus students to exchange books called **BookBridge**.

Harry visits the site and logs in with his university email. He sees that he can filter by department and search for class names and codes, not just book name or ISBN. He types in "EECS 202: Circuits 1" and finds two results: one for sale, one available for borrowing.

He's elated! Clicking on the borrow option, he sees it's listed by a student named [*Mary*](mary_the_lender.md). He uses the in-app message function to send her a message:

> **Harry:** Hi Mary! I saw that you listed Circuits 1 book and I was wondering if I could get it for the upcoming Fall semester?

Mary is quick to reply, and they agree on a pickup time at Spahr Library first floor. Harry confirms the borrow sent by Mary which sets a reminder for the return date.

Before signing out, he adds a few more titles to his Wishlist and subscribes to notifications for when someone lists them, so that he's better prepared with the books this Fall. 

He's happy and not stressed for the first time thinking that textbooks might not feel like a burden anymore to him.
