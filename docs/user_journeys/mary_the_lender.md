## Mary the Lender

Mary is an out-of-state student, living alone in a cozy studio apartment, her first time away from home. She originally enrolled as an Electrical Engineering major but after her first year, she's decided to switch to Computer Science starting this Fall.

College life has escalated quickly for her. She's learning how to cook for herself, budget groceries, keep up with lectures, and adapt to the pace of a new city, and all this while juggling her changing academic path. She's not tight with her pocket but the space in her apartment is definitely an issue, and textbooks from past semesters are starting to pile up on her single floating shelf.

One quiet evening, as she recognizes her study corner, she couldn't help but notice "Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, 7th edition" which was her book for EECS 202: Circuits 1 course last semester. That's a book she would have needed this Fall for the follow-up class EECS 212: Circuits 2, but well not anymore. She maintained the book in great shape anticipating the next class but now it feels wasteful to let it gather dust.

She remembers a conversation in class about BookBridge. She signs up using her university email and lists her book. The platform lets her choose whether she wants to sell or lend her book. Since she knows how expensive books can be and how hard it was to find this book last semester, she chooses to lend her book, hoping it might help someone in need.

The next day, she receives a message from [*Harry*](harry_the_borrower.md), another EE student.

Mary checks his profile, and agrees to give him the book. They meet on campus for quick hand off. She sets the start and end date on her side as mutually discussed. 

She walks away feeling satisfied. Not only did she free up space in her apartment, but she also helped someone on a journey she was a part of.

Later that week, Mary adds a few more books that she doesn't need. She's moved on from EE and now in her CS era. BookBridge gives her a title of **"Campus Contributor: Level 2 (5+ books)"**.
